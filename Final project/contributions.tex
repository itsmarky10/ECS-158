\section{Contributions}

The group met to complete the project in a mob programming like fashion. Each
member contributed to the development of the code and the algorithms equally. The original
concept of B-Spline regression was proposed by Brian Vargas, who also typed the \LaTeX  file.
Mark Fan, Michael Banzon, and Max Matsumoto wrote much of the write up as a word
document which Brian later edited, converted, and completed the missing sections.
